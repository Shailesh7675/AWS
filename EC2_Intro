**************EC2*******************
EC2 stand for elastic cloud and compute
An AWS EC2 instance is a virtual server in the cloud that you can rent from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run your applications and workloads
It provides you with computing resources such as CPU (processing power), memory, storage, and networking capabilities

When you launch an EC2 instance, you can choose the instance type that suits your needs Each instance type has different specifications, 
such as the amount of CPU, memory, and storage it offers. You can select the instance type that matches the requirements of your application or workload.

EC2 instances are commonly used for a wide range of purposes, such as hosting websites and web applications, running backend services,
performing data processing and analytics, and supporting development and testing environments.

EC2 instances are highly flexible. You can easily scale them up or down based on demand. If your application needs more resources to handle increased traffic, 
you can add more instances. Similarly, if the demand decreases, you can reduce the number of instances to save costs.

In summary, an AWS EC2 instance is a virtual server in the cloud that provides you with computing resources to run your applications. It offers flexibility, scalability, 
and remote accessibility, making it a fundamental component of cloud-based infrastructure
